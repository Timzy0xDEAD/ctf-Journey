# CTF Journey

Just my personal collection from playing around with Capture The Flag challenges and learning security along the way.  

## About This Repo
I keep all my writeups, scripts, and notes here. Some solves are clean, some are messy. Some took 20 minutes, some took days of head-scratching. Either way, I learned something from each one.  

## What’s Inside
- **writeups/** – How I solved challenges  
- **tools/** – Quick scripts I threw together  
- **notes/** – Stuff I want to remember  
- **resources/** – Links I actually use  

## Why I’m Doing This
CTFs are fun puzzles that actually make you think. This repo helps me:  
- Track what I’ve learned  
- Remember solutions for later  
- Share cool stuff with others  
- See how far I’ve come  

## How I Work
I write things the way I wish someone had explained them to me: simple and clear, no fluff.  
Most scripts are quick hacks, not masterpieces.
